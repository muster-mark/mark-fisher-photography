  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>Caldeirão Verde (Green Cauldron). One of Madeira's many levada walks ends here for now, due to the path further on to Caldeirão do Inferno being closed owing to rockfall, a frequent occurrence in Madeira's vertiginous terrain.</p>\n<p>The flowering shrub in the foreground on the left is Erysimum Bicolor, a shrub which  is very variable in its form, but easily identified by its white and lilac flowers. I was surprised to read that it is not very common, since I spotted it all over the place. But it is pretty hard to miss when it is in flower, and is quite widely distributed.</p>"
