  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>Some bog pondweed (I think) in the New Forest. Although it is one of the most common pondweeds here in the UK, it is under threat in many European countries, even being considered critically endangered in Czechia.</p>\n<p>This stream runs inside the curiously named “Bishop of Winchester's Purlieu”, an irregularly shaped area of land enclosed by a bank and two ditches. According to local legend, King John granted to the Bishop of Winchester as much land as he could crawl around in a day. Having a dignified portliness befitting his elevated position, the bishop had a contraption to support himself, and managed to crawl around a sizeable area, at least considering the challenges posed by the bogginess and vegetation which were present at least when I visited eight centuries later.</p>\n"
