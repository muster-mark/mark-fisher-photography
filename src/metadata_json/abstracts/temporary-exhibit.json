  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>Frozen conditions are not common where I live in the London suburbs, and it's always a painful experience if I miss the photographic opportunities presented by sub-zero temperatures.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, this cold snap was one I managed to capitalise on. This frozen puddle wouldn't have lasted much longer than a day or so after I took this photo.</p>"
