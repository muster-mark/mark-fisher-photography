  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>This birch tree has nearly lost all its leaves as autumn creeps onwards. But it won't go into the colder months looking drab; this plunging number from Ralph Lichen's autumn/winter collection, which is bang on trend with its 100% natural materials, will make it stand out from the crowd. Such an excessive amount of both both moss and lichen in one outfit can raise a few eyebrows, sometimes being considered OTT. But this tree has the charisma to pull it off.</p>\n"
