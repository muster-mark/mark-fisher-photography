  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>An early morning outing to the three-Corbetts-in-1 wonder that is Quinag was well rewarded with some excellent light and calm conditions.</p>\n<p>I headed up initially to the Bealach at the junction of the Y-shaped crest, as it seemed the best place to quickly take advantage of the light. I didn't get any further than that since proceeding any further than that without crampons didn't seem like a bright idea. But short as it was, it was a hike that will stick in my memory for a long time.</p>\n<p>This view is looking away from Quinag over Kylesku (hidden from view) towards the peaks of the Sutherland National Scenic Area.</p>"
