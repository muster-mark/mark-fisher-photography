  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>A view across the Sea of the Hebrides from Talisker Bay to South Uist. I had walked a loop from Talisker, first skirting the dramatic and rugged sea cliffs of the Minginish peninsula before turning inland to visit Preshal More and Preshore Beg, with their impressive dolerite columns. There was enough of the day left to get to Talisker Bay for sunset, where I saw the only 2 people I saw that day. It's amazing how footfall in Skye is concentrated into such a small number of hotspots, but I'm not complaining when I can get a sunset on such a fantastic beach nearly to myself.</p>\n<p>The Sea of the Hebrides is a huge Marine Protected Area which contains rich feeding grounds for minke whales and basking sharks.</p>"
