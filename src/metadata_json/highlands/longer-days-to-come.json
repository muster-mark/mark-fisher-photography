  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>A view from Uig Beach on an evening when the light just kept on giving and giving. So much so that I was still up shooting after it had turned 11pm, though that might also have had something to do with being nearly as close to Iceland as to London only 2 weeks before the summer solstice.</p>\n<p>The slope of Uig Beach is extremely shallow, and so the rising tide devours the beach at a brisk rate. I clambered up and hover Machair Carnish to Tràigh Bhoisadair (Bhoisadair Beach) shortly after taking this shot, and by the time I came back an hour or two later there was no option but to get my socks wet.</p>"
