  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>When dismantling my old I shed, I held on to the door to photograph these snail trails on the algae. Or are they slug trails? I would lean towards snails because they seem to be a bit more arboreal than slugs, at least in my garden. I've seen snails up in my hazel tree, but the slugs don't seem to have such a head for heights. My brother was interested in having the old door for his back garden, to replace a gate that had been broken by foxes. When I told him I wanted to hang on to it for a bit to photograph the snail trails on it, his response was &quot;Because that's a normal thing to want to do&quot;. Though I suspect he meant to insinuate the opposite.</p>\n<p>I moved the door to the sunny part of my garden and now the algae has faded to a shadow of its former glory.</p>"
