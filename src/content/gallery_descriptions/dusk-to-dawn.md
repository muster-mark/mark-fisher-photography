Walking in the woods at night is the surest way of having it for yourself. Which is just the way I like it. Many people
like to go to the woods for the mindfulness aspect of it, but this is multiplied 10 times when walking by moonlight.
Being mostly deprived of your primary sense of vision and no longer bombarded by a deluge of information, you become
much more aware of your other senses and are able to pay attention to everything happening both inside and outside of
you.

If you do plan on going out walking by the full moon, make sure to stick to well-known paths that you know present no
significant hazards. And bring a phone with a charged battery just in case &mdash; though it would be just as well to
keep it switched off unless you are given cause to need it. After all, the entire point is to feel unplugged for
once.
