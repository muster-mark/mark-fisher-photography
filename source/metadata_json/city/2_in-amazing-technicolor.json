  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>This light show in Fremont Street was Downton Vegas' fightback against the gradual migration of activity the Strip. In attempt to lure back visitors, after the CEO of Paramount pictures refused permission to build a Starship Enterprise I thought this girl, standing alone, would make the perfect foreground to the light show. As I walked towards her, I suddenly realised that her perfect position was not as fortuitous as I first though - I saw in my peripheral vision she was with a friend and he was taking pictures of her, and that I was walking right in-between them! Fortunately he didn't notice as he had his eye to the viewfinder, and she didn't notice as she was looking the other way, giving me a chance to avoid the embarrassment, taking a position behind and to this side of him, profiting from his good directing. Thanks random dude!</p>\n",
