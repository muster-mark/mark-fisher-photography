  "CaptionAbstract": "Padlocks left on the Pont des Arts in Paris by lovers young and old. The keys were thrown into the Seine according to ancient tradition. Not really though - the \"tradition\" only lasted for 7 years. By 2015 they numbered around the million mark and were removed for the sake of the bridge's structural integrity.  The bridge is now decorated with padlock-themed street art on light-weight and unpadlockable wooden boards.",
