Ants are attracted to the elaiosomes (fleshy structures attached to the seeds) and the native ants carry the seeds back to their nests to eat the elaiosomes, where the seeds are protected underground from fires as well as from being eaten by other animals. After a fire, the seeds then germinate. Invasive ants, on the other hand, are less concerned about the sustainability of their food source and gorge on the elaiosomes without performing the necessary duties, leaving the seeds unprotected from fire.</p>\n<p>But then the invasive ants would hardly be upholding the spirit of colonialism if they didn't ride roughshod over their new turf with complete indifference to the long-term ecological consequences of disrupting the delicate balance in which their evictees had lived in harmony for millennia.</p>\n"

Hutton used such locations as evidence for his theory of how the Earth's crust is continually undergoing the same natural processes today which formed it as it is in the present day. This theory of Uniformitarianism, as it was called, challenged the then accepted idea that the Earth was only a few thousand years old.\nThat was in the late 18th century, but it was only in the early 20th century that estimates of the age of the Earth reached the billions rather than millions of years, at least without being largely ignored.</p>\n"

      "CaptionAbstract": "<p>Boreray, part of the St. Kilda archipelago, wastes no time getting to the point, being the smallest Scottish island with an elevation of over 1000ft. It is home to the world's 2nd largest colony of northern gannet, which were the staple food of the St. Kildans for most of the island's history, until a demand for fulmar products (oil and feathers) in the 18th century persuaded them to develop a taste for the smaller bird.\nDespite being even more inhospitable than Hirta, the main island of the archipelago, archaeological evidence suggests Boreray was inhabited at one point. In more recent times, Boreray was only temporarily inhabited for the purposes of catching gannets and puffins (the latter quarry being reserved for the women), and tending the semi-feral sheep. When in distress, communication was made with Hirta by inverting patches of turf, the position and size of which could signify either lack of provisions, illness, injury or death.</p>\n"

Its woods in particular—; including Meenfield wood, which is the one you can see in this photo — are carpeted with blubells in the spring.</p>\n<p>It's amazing that I took this photo over 2 years ago, but haven't had time to upload it here (or any other photos for that matter, until last weekend) since starting my job shortly before this photo was taken. Hopefully I will start getting back into the swing of things now. I guess I let this website slip down a bit in my priorities, but I have recently decided to bump it up to number 2 in my list (after surviving/paying the bills).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I would highly recommend doing the Darent Valley Path if you live in the south-east London Area. Someone I met once told me that tears came to his eyes when he reached the sea after walking the length of the Thames. You will probably manage to keep dry eyes upon reaching the muddy banks of the Thames after following the journey of its little tributary, but it's still a worthwhile excursion if you only have a day to spare.</p>\n"

As I walked towards her, I suddenly realised that her perfect position was not as fortuitous as I first though - I saw in my peripheral vision she was with a friend and he was taking pictures of her, and that I was walking right in-between them! Fortunately he didn't notice as he had his eye to the viewfinder, and she didn't notice as she was looking the other way, giving me a chance to avoid the embarrassment, taking a position behind and to this side of him, profiting from his good directing.

I decided to head back to this disused mine shaft, The Old Engine Shaft, to try and capture some star trails.\nI was curious what exactly the tower was used for. Apparently it held a trough feeding a huge water wheel which powered the pump and winding gear used in the shaft.\nWell done if you spotted the shooting star.  This occurred within the first few frames so I was lucky enough to see it with my own eyes. Later I would have been too busy alternating between trying to sleep and trying to keep warm to notice it. Neither with much luck.</p>\n"
