  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>Watching the heavy rain and strong winds as Storm Brendan raged outside, I knew that there would be some good photos to be had after it had all died down. I got to Crofton Woods maybe slightly later than I had hoped and it was already pretty dark, but I had brought my headtorch with me so it was the perfect time to try out a bit of light painting.</p>\n<p>This branch is lying in what is usually a path, only it was flooded as far as I could see (at least by the light of my headtorch) and deeper than Kyd Brook is most of the time. I spent quite a while improving the technique of illuminating all of the different bits of it evenly without illuminating any of the water, and by the time I had finished it was almost pitch black.</p>\n"
