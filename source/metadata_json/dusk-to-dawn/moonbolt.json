  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>The moon throws down a bolt of light, using this birch tree as its vehicle. I took a spontaneous moonlit stroll through the woods near my house on the recent full moon, and it reminded me of the last time I did so, when I took my camera and made this photo. I'm planning to plan ahead next time and take my camera out on the next full moon.</p>\n"
