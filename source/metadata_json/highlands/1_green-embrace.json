  "CaptionAbstract": "A clump of ferns cluster around a boulder in Glen Sannox on the Isle of Arran. Arran is a mecca for students of geology, who swarm to the island in summer months, and are known affectionately (I presume) to the locals as \"Jolly Boys\".  I guess it's hard not to be happy when surrounded by a magnificent glacial landscape such as this.\rI think the gender balance in the Earth Sciences is better than it used to be: perhaps the phrase has remained unchanged because it has a certain ring to it.",
