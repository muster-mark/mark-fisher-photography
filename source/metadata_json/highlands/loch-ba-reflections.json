  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>The reflections of the hills behind Loch Bà, basking in the evening light, was what drew my attention to surface of the loch and made me certain there was an image to be made there. Luckily, the breeze was blowing across the loch with just the right strength to create some lovely undulations without them growing big enough to become angular and choppy.</p>\n<p>More commonplace subject matter could scarcely be harder (or easier?!) to find, but the confluence of perfect conditions just begged for me to take my camera out.</p>\n"
