  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>Surprisingly, though I remember the day clearly, I have no recollection of taking this particular photograph and was quite suprised by it when going through my library. There were a lot of interesting things going on with the light that evening, and given that this was such an easy shot to take - no need to carefully compose with the foreground for example - I guess it didn't really register that much and was pushed out of my mind by other images from that day which took more deliberation to make, and which I probably thought stronger at the time.</p>\n<p>Still a good one though, I'd say.</p>\n"
