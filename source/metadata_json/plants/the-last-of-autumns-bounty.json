  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>When I stopped for lunch under this small-leaved lime tree during a walk along part of Offa's Dyke Path, I didn't realise that it would also give me the strongest image of the day.</p>\n<p>Small-leaved limes are indicators of ancient woodland in the UK, and this lime tree is not lying - the misty backdrop you see here is Cadora woods, one of the many areas of ancient woodland in the Wye Valley.</p>\n"
