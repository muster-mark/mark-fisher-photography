  "CaptionAbstract": "I had spotted this oak tree some distance off the path during my walks in Crofton woods, and had been intending to take my camera to take a photo of it, being as magnificent as it is. When I finally did, and went off the path to approach it, I was shocked to discover that it was right next to another path that I walked along several times before, completely failing to notice this tree as anything particularly interesting from the other side.\rIt just goes to show what a change of direction can do, and also just how disorienting woods can be. Even when you think you know them, they still have the capacity to surprise you.",
