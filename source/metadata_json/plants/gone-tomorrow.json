  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>A beech forest near the shores of Loch Ard looking at its best.</p>\n<p>Every year, Autumn is over way before I've had my fill of it, as if the trees either don't realise or don't care what a show they're putting on as they discard leaves they no longer have use for in order to conserve resources and survive. The one good thing about this hasty indifference though, is that it stops you from taking Autumn for granted.</p>\n"
