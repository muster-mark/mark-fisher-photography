  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>If you're walking the <a href=\"https://explorekent.org/activities/darent-valley-path/\">Darent Valley Path</a> from Sevenoaks to the Thames, Shoreham is one of the most delightful places you will pass through on the way, and well worth planning a bit of extra time for. Its woods in particular—; including Meenfield wood, which is the one you can see in this photo — are carpeted with blubells in the spring.</p>\n<p>It's amazing that I took this photo over 2 years ago, but haven't had time to upload it here (or any other photos for that matter, until last weekend) since starting my job shortly before this photo was taken. Hopefully I will start getting back into the swing of things now. I guess I let this website slip down a bit in my priorities, but I have recently decided to bump it up to number 2 in my list (after surviving/paying the bills).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I would highly recommend doing the Darent Valley Path if you live in the south-east London Area. Someone I met once told me that tears came to his eyes when he reached the sea after walking the length of the Thames. You will probably manage to keep dry eyes upon reaching the muddy banks of the Thames after following the journey of its little tributary, but it's still a worthwhile excursion if you only have a day to spare.</p>\n"
