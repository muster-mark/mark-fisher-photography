  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>A couple of years ago I went to the US on what is possibly the most spontaneous business trip ever to have occurred (Thursday: &quot;Where do you fancy going?&quot;, and we were on a plane to Los Angeles on Friday morning!).</p>\n<p>One day saw us driving back to LA through the Mojave National Preserve. It was definitely a mixed blessing being in a new and amazing place while being somewhat limited in my ability to get out and explore it properly. Thankfully the desert is a kind place to the photographer and we happened to be there at the right time of day, so it didn't take long to find some half-decent compositions during a road-side stop by the Granite Mountains.</p>\n"
