  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>I loved the patterns left on the beach at Whiteford Sands on the Gower Peninsula. Although the patterns repeated over quite large areas, every so often the pattern would change to something distinctly different, as if the sea had got bored of doing the same thing over and over again and decided to move on to something new.</p>\n<p>This particular pattern looks a bit like tyre tracks, but is completely naturally formed.</p>\n"
