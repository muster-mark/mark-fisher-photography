  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>Taken on an overnight hiking trip to some cabins near Troms√∏. It was mid-November and snow had not yet fallen, so this was the last remains from the previous year. With less than 2 weeks to go until permanent night time, the sun no longer rose high enough for this snow to have to endure it's direct rays, so it would live to see another (polar) day.</p>\n"
