  "CaptionAbstract": "Me editing my photos could hardly be called a spectator sport. This guy, on the other hand, has turned making art into an art form.\rVying for attention with contortionists, musicians and other street performers, Tony Vegas produces his paintings in frenzies of movement, sound and colour which draw sizeable crowds. He is seen here showing off a finished creation at the Fremont Street Experience.\rSee him making a painting in just under 7 minutes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNJtyFu1dEs\">here</a>",
