  "CaptionAbstract": "<p>These sheep are natural models, and didn't need any direction from me to form this pleasing positioning.</p>\n<p>The Isle of Sheppey is an island in the Thames Estuary, and it's name is derived from Old English Sceapig, meaning &quot;Sheep Island&quot;. Besides sheep, it is also home to a creature you would be slightly more surprised to find in the UK  â€” the <a href=\"https://animaldiversity.org/site/accounts/information/Euscorpius_flavicaudis.html\">European yellow-tailed scorpion</a>, which hitched a ride from Italy on a ship in the 18th century and found the UK climate not too disagreeable, apparently. They can survive here thanks to an extremely slow metabolism, only bothering to move for the strict essentials of hunting for food (which sometimes includes each other) and mating.</p>\n",
