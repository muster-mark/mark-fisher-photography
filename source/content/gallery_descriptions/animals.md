I'm not much of a wildlife photographer to be honest. I prefer to be moving around and exploring rather than sitting
around waiting in a hide for an animal that may or may not come. And as all good adventures are made on foot rather than
in a vehicle, I prefer to travel light and don't even own a lens long enough to be considered a proper wildlife lens.

Nevertheless, I have acquired the odd animal photo over the years. I hope you enjoy them.
